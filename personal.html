<p class="bio">Ashley enjoys spending time with her husband of 10 years, Gerry, and their 8-year-old black lab, Moxxi, who bring joy and balance to her daily life. Committed to her personal health journey, Ashley has successfully lost 70 pounds since May 2024 and continues to stay active through challenging and motivating lifting sessions and Hotworx workouts. When she is not focused on schoolwork or at the gym, she can often be found curled up with a good book from her ever-growing personal library, or playing some of her favorite video games online. </p>
